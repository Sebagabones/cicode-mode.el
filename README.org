Cicode-mode is a major mode for Emacs.

I wrote this as my current job involves writing [[https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/plant-scada/page/1130115.html][Cicode]], and the only editor that had some support for it (aside from the, er, terrible built in editor that came with Citect/PlantSCADA) was Notepad++.

As an Emacs user, this would not do, and so I quickly made ~cicode-mode~. It is not particularly good, and any contributions are welcome. Do note that this is my first attempt at making a mode for Emacs, and I do not think that I am very good at elisp.

*** Features
- There is indentation
- There is colour
- There is not much else

*** Known Bugs/Limitations
- ~SELECT CASE~ indentation is very broken
- I have not tried to implement support for any of the ~:#~ syntax
- /Some/ of the inbuilt functions are picked up as inbuilts, but I doubt all of them are.
- There are a few bugs with the syntax highlighting
