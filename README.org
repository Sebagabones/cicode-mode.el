Cicode-mode is a major mode for Emacs.

I wrote this as my current job involves writing [[https://docs.aveva.com/bundle/plant-scada/page/1130115.html][Cicode]], and the only editor (at the time) that had some support for it (aside from the, er, terrible built in editor that came with Citect/PlantSCADA) was Notepad++. Although, there now exists a [[https://github.com/MSkjel/cicode-vscode-extension][vscode extension]] - which may or may not have inspired me to add some additional improvements to cicode-mode :P.

As an Emacs user, this would not do, and so I quickly made ~cicode-mode~. It is not particularly good, and any contributions are welcome. Do note that this is my first attempt at making a mode for Emacs, and I do not think that I am very good at elisp.

*** Installation
Using =use-package=:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package cicode-mode
  :straight (cicode-mode :type git :host github :repo "Sebagabones/cicode-mode.el")
  :ensure t  )
#+end_src
*** Example:
[[file:doc/example.png]]


*** Features
- Indentation
- Syntax Highlighting
  - This includes the lesser known parts of Cicode, including support for variable/function scope.
- There is now completion using capf! I have not tested it with company, but corfu does work (and there are even docs with corfu-popupinfo).
- Eldoc support for documentation - including syntax highlighted examples!

An example of inbuilt documentation (I am using [[https://github.com/casouri/eldoc-box][eldoc-box]]): [[file:doc/example2.png]]

*** Roadmap:
- Add in additional completions for things like ~FUNCTION~ ect.
- I would quite like the ability to parse in ~.ci~ files, producing completions/gotos for non-builtin functions.
  - This may be in the form of treesitter, or I may use simple regex parsing - feel free to contribute ideas/thoughts :)
